#### A Kepler Mapper simplicial complex made using 5 parameters:
- affectedDAC: the number of people within a 3 mile radius of each coal plant that are considered to be members of Disadvantaged Communities
- PM 2.5 Emssions (tons): Amount of particulate matter 2.5 released annually
- post2004RetrofitCosts: dollars spent on pollution control retrofits after 2004
- CO2limitsOppose: the percent of people who oppose setting CO2 limits on coal powerplant emissions
- StateMineEmployment: the number of people employed by coal mining operations in the state in which the powerplant is located
